The file "inst_constraint.sv" in this directory was taken from the
Ridecore demo shown at the San Diego DARPA Integration Exercise:

https://github.com/makaimann/ride-core-demo

It has minor differences with the RV32M instruction constraints file
"../../ISA\ Constraints/inst_constraint_RV32M.sv"

We need to clarify why there are differences (maybe for the purpose of
the demo?)
