#################################
MORE ERROR DETECTION / HELP USER
#################################

- Add more error detection in parser + generators.

- Create format file checker that informs user of potential issues - like including fields that are not defined.

- Figure out a method to help wire SQED to a processor (move qed_ready signal logic, think of a new way / automate).

- Is there a way to generate the format file / make a tool that can help the user generate it. 

############
NEW FEATURES
############

- Generate .ssts files for SIC.

- Add feature for supporting different types of definitions (not just =).
  We can add support for <, >, <=, >=, =.
  
- Add feature for allowing the use of the instruction itself (not just the
  defined bit fields) when making definitions. Maybe just add it to the bit
  fields section. 
    
- Add feature for allowing the use of indexing in definitions, for both 
  the LHS and RHS. Example would be instruction[5:0] < 111011.
  
#####
FIXES
#####
 
- Make tool generate the cache and mux files in case instructions are different bit-widths.

- Fixes in SIC_generator.py

#################################
FUTURE DIRECTION / ORGANIZATIONAL
#################################

- Need tool to generalize better (try another ISA).

- Create case study sub-directories in git repo that are complete for a demo (and work).

- Clean up and comment code.
